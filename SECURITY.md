2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact the maintainers directly through secure channels

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description** - Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce** - Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact Assessment** - Potential impact and affected components
- **Proof of Concept** - Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue
- **Suggested Fix** - If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity and severity

## Security Implementation

### Environment Configuration

#### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Database Connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-cryptographically-secure-secret-minimum-32-characters

# Application
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
CLIENT_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Security (Optional)
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
```

#### Security Validation
The application includes automated environment validation:
- JWT secret strength verification (32+ characters required)
- MongoDB URI format validation
- Required environment variable checks
- Production configuration validation

### Security Middleware Stack

```javascript
// Security headers
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"]
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));

// Rate limiting
app.use(rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP'
}));

// CORS configuration
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.CLIENT_URL,
  credentials: true
}));
```

## Production Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Requirements

#### Environment Setup
- [ ] Replace all development credentials with production values
- [ ] Generate cryptographically secure JWT secret (32+ characters)
- [ ] Configure production MongoDB connection with strong credentials
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Configure HTTPS URLs for all endpoints
- [ ] Set up proper CORS origins

#### Database Security
- [ ] Create dedicated production database user with minimal privileges
- [ ] Enable MongoDB Atlas IP whitelisting
- [ ] Configure database encryption at rest
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Enable database audit logging

#### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Implement DDoS protection
- [ ] Configure server firewall rules
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection system

#### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Configure security event logging

### Security Testing

#### Automated Security Checks
```bash
# Run security validation
npm run security:check

# Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Run security-focused tests
npm run test:security
```

#### Manual Security Testing
- [ ] Verify HTTPS redirects work correctly
- [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Validate security headers in browser dev tools
- [ ] Confirm CORS policy blocks unauthorized origins
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization flows
- [ ] Verify input validation and sanitization

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Code Security

- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Implement multi-factor authentication where possible
- Set appropriate session timeouts
- Implement account lockout policies
- Log authentication attempts and failures

#### Data Handling

- Implement proper data retention policies
- Follow GDPR and privacy regulations
- Secure backup and recovery procedures
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### For Deployment

#### Server Hardening
- Keep operating system and software updated
- Disable unnecessary services and ports
- Configure proper firewall rules
- Implement intrusion detection and prevention
- Regular security patches and updates

#### Network Security
- Use VPC or private networks where possible
- Implement network segmentation
